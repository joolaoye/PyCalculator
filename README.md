## About
  > A GUI calculator developed in Python using the tkinter library, inspired by the features of the Casio fx-991ES Plus model. 
  <br><br>
  The calculator's graphical user interface is designed to mirror the Casio model, providing users with an interface that is both familiar and intuitive. Advanced mathematical functions, including trigonometry, and logarithms, are incorporated into the calculator.
It provides an immersive experience with chess.com-inspired sound effects and an enhanced graphical user interface featuring board highlighting, elevating gameplay and user experience.
